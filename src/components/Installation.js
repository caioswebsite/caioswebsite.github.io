            Borges Virtualis is a trans-media installation that takes the audience on a journey, starting with the familiar experience of watching a movie in a theater, to the full VR immersion, into the world of the story and the characters themselves. Borges Virtualis is anchored in a 1978 film adaptation of Borgesâ€™ <span className='italic'>The Intruder</span> (The story of an 1800s-era peasant woman, who is enslaved by two brothers who fight over her possession, only to end up being murdered by them).
