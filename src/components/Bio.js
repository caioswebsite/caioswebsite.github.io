          <p className='bio-text'>
              Caio Ribeiro is a native of Brazil. After completing film school in New York, he pursued a career as a director of photography. Throughout the 1990s, he shot multiple heavy metal and hip-hop videos for the likes of <span className='italic'>Brutal Truth</span>, <span className='italic'>Main Source</span>, <span className='italic'>Lords Of The Underground</span>, and others, achieving broad recognition with the breakthrough video "Shook Ones" by <span className='italic'>Mob Deep</span>.
              <br />
              <br />
              In the mid 1990s, Caio started to write and direct narrative films. His first short film, <span className='italic'>Ballad for Two Lovers</span>, won the an award for Best Director at the Brussels Film Festival in Belgium in 1999.
              <br />
              <br />
              Caio's first feature film, <span className='italic'>Sometime in August</span>, was named an official selection at the Los Angeles Independent Film Festival, the Florida Independent Film Festival, and nominated for Best American Independent Film of 1999.
              <br />
              <br />
              From 1999 to 2004, Caio wrote and served as director of photography for two World War II films, <span className='italic'>Last Letters from Monte Rosa</span> and <span className='italic'>The Fallen</span>. Both films were winners of multiple awards and distributed internationally. Always a fan of <span className='italic'>The Twilight Zone</span>, Ribeiro filmed <span className='italic'>The Realm</span> from 2007 to 2012, a sci-fi tetralogy about characters who, due to extreme trauma, enter a dimension where past and present become one, where reality and fantasy collide, and where people suffer from the wounds they inflict on others.
              <br />
              <br />
              In 2021, Caio completed the seven year long shoot of <span className='italic'>Branded By Fire</span>, about his traumatic childhood juxtaposed with the stories of enslaved political prisoners of the Argentinian dictatorship (1976-83).
              <br />
              <br />
              Caio is currently developing <span className='italic'>Borges Virtualis</span>, a <span className='italic'>VR installation</span> that immerses the <span className='italic'>player</span> into a film adaptation of Borgesâ€™ <span className='italic'>The Intruder</span>, and the historical reality surrounding the shoot.
